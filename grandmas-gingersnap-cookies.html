    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup cinnamon sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground ginger</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dark molasses</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Directions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place cinnamon sugar in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt into a mixing bowl. Stir the mixture until blended, then sift a second time into another bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Gradually beat in white sugar. Add egg and molasses and beat until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Sift 1/3 of the flour mixture into the butter mixture; stir to thoroughly blend. Sift in the remaining flour mixture and mix together until a soft dough forms.</li>
        <li>Pinch off small amounts of dough and roll them with your hands into 1-inch-diameter balls.</li>
        <li>Place balls in cinnamon sugar and roll to coat, then place 2-inches apart on ungreased baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops are rounded and slightly cracked, about 10 minutes, switching racks halfway through. Cool cookies on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
